# This is a self-made version of a modified duplicate of the original Pong game.
# The AI and User each have 3 paddles, one on the bottom, one on the top, and one on the left or right side (left is CPU, right is User).
# To move the paddles, use the up, down, left, and right keys. The left and right keys will move both the top and bottom paddles.
# To exit the game at any time, use the 'q' key or click on the X button at the top right of the application.

# I hope you enjoy my game. :)
